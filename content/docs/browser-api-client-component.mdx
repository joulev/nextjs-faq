The name "client component" is actually quite misleading. It's not a component that _exclusively_ runs in the browser. It's a component that runs on the **server** and the client. The code inside the component is executed first on the **server** and the client or in other words, it's [prerendered on the server and then hydrated on the client](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components#full-page-load).

During that initial prerendering, since the component is rendered on the server, it doesn't have access to the browser APIs named above. Hence you got that error.

There are 2 fixes for this problem:

- move logic using browser-specific APIs to `useEffect` (or an event handler, or any place that only runs on the client)
- use the component dynamically with `next/dynamic` and `ssr: false`

## Moving logic to `useEffect`

If we move the logic inside `useEffect` hook, it will only run on the client. So, we can use these APIs without any problem.

```tsx
"use client";

export default function Page() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    setTheme(localStorage.getItem("theme"));
  }, []);

  if (!theme) return <div>Theme is loading</div>;
  return <div>Theme is {theme}</div>;
}
```

Note that if you do it this way, as you can see you need a loading state, which may cause a flash of unstyled content (FOUC). To overcome it, you have to use a `<script>` (or [`next/script`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts)) to get the value _before_ hydration and configure styling based on that using _vanilla_ JavaScript. For theming specifically, we recommend [`next-themes`](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) which handles this problem very well, so you don't have to touch all this `<script>` and `useEffect` shenanigans.

By the way, there are already plenty of existing solutions made for many of these problems. For example, for `localStorage` handling, you can have [`useLocalStorage`](https://usehooks-ts.com/react-hook/use-local-storage).

## Using `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false`

If we [import a component dynamically with `ssr: false`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading#skipping-ssr), it will only run on the client, at the cost of the content not being available in the initial HTML (so crawlers may not be able to see it). If that is fine for you, you can proceed to use these APIs without any problem.

```tsx
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const Content = dynamic(() => import("./content.tsx"), { ssr: false });

export default function Page() {
  return <Content />;
}
```
