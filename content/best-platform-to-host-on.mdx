The ideal platform to host your Next.js application depends on your needs. [Vercel](https://vercel.com) is a popular choice for its seamless integration with Next.js, but there are other options available for different requirements. For alternative hosting setups, refer to [these official code examples](https://github.com/orgs/nextjs/repositories) to explore platforms like Render and Fly.io.

<Callout type="warn">
  Vercel or any other serverless hosting platform does not support long-running servers like
  Socket.IO. For such use cases, consider hosting on serverful platforms like Render or Fly.io.
</Callout>

If you prefer to self-host, you can use a VPS with Docker. For setup guidance, refer to the [Docker
configuration docs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker) and
[multi-environment Docker setup
docs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker-multi-env). Self-hosting
allows you to handle long-running tasks effectively.
