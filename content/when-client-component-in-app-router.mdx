> When is a component a client component, in the app router? Does adding context providers make the entire app client components?

A component is only a client component if:

- it is explicitly marked as a client component, using the `"use client"` directive, or
- it is imported to a client component.

In all other cases, the component is a server component. That includes when the component is passed as props (e.g. `children`) to a client component. Hence, you can [wrap layout files' `children` inside context providers](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#context) without losing the server component benefits in your application (i.e. your pages are still server components by default unless you explicitly opt out with `"use client"`).

Do note that when a component X is imported to a client component Y, X is rendered as a client component for that case only, and is still a server component by default elsewhere, unless you explicitly used the `"use client"` directive.

## Example

In the following example

```tsx
"use client";
import ServerComponent from "./server-component";

export default function ClientComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ServerComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

`ServerComponent` is rendered as a client component, but in the following example

```tsx
"use client";

export default function ClientComponent({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}
```

```tsx
import ClientComponent from "./client-component";
import ServerComponent from "./server-component";

export default function AnotherServerComponent() {
  return (
    <ClientComponent>
      <ServerComponent />
    </ClientComponent>
  );
}
```

then `ServerComponent` is rendered as a server component as expected (except if `AnotherServerComponent` is imported to a different client component).
