title: How to set metadata to page.tsx rendered as client components?

> [The `export const metadata` syntax](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata) seems to not work if `page.tsx` is a client component. How do I set my page title and other metadata then?

The `metadata`, `generateMetadata`, `viewport` and `generateViewport` exports are only supported in server components. Hence, you need to make your page a server component to use them. A method to do that is to move all your client-side logic to a separate client component and import that client component to the now-server component `page.tsx`. So instead of

```tsx
// page.tsx
"use client";
export default function Page() {
  useSomeHook();
  return <Something />;
}
export const metadata = { title: "My Page" };
```

you need to make a new client component, say `page.client.tsx`, and import it to `page.tsx`:

```tsx
// page.client.tsx
"use client";
export default function PageClient() {
  useSomeHook();
  return <Something />;
}

// page.tsx
import PageClient from "./page.client";
export default function Page() {
  return <PageClient />;
}
export const metadata = { title: "My Page" };
```

## How do I set dynamic metadata that depends on client-side states?

_As far as I know_, there isn't an official guide for this yet, and I am looking forward to an official guide on this soon. If you know of the officially recommended way to do it, please [help me improve this page](https://github.com/joulev/nextjs-faq/blob/main/content/metadata-client-components.mdx). For now I'm using the following workaround which seems to work well, but as long as it is not officially endorsed by the Next.js documentation or the React.js documentation, **it is only a workaround for now** so use at your own risk.

```tsx
"use client";
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Page() {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState("Hello World");
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Yes, we simply put the <title> tag anywhere in the document. */}
      <title>{title}</title>
      <input value={title} onChange={e => setTitle(e.target.value)} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
