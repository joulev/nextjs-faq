## Is there a Vercel discord server?

No, and the Next.js Discord server is focused on Next.js the framework only, not on Vercel the hosting provider, so questions like "How do I fix this error while deploying _SvelteKit_ to Vercel?" are off-topic in the server. For Vercel specific questions we encourage you to seek [suitable Vercel support channels](https://vercel.com/help) or the [official Vercel community](https://vercel.community).

## How do I report a message or a person in the server to the moderation team?

It depends on what kind of thing you want to report.

- If you want to report a message, right click the message (long tap on mobile) and select "Apps" &rarr; "Report". It will log the report and the moderation team will be able to see it, and non-mod members won't be able to see your report.

  Please use this option for things you would like moderators to act on only. Do not abuse this option as a way to "soft-ping" to get moderators' attention on your question/query.

- You can also ping moderators directly by mentioning `@Moderator` in your message. The "Report" option does not ping us (at the moment), so use this ping when you need immediate help from a moderator. Once again, only use the ping when you have something to report, do _not_ use it to get attention to a technical question for example. You may get muted or more if you abuse this ping.

- If you want to report a person, you can get moderator attention by either mentioning `@Moderator` or by going to `#discord-feedback` with a message like ``I would like to report a person.'' A moderator will give you further instructions.

## How do I format my message nicely?

Most basic Markdown syntax is now supported by Discord, you should therefore use Markdown to format your message. [Learn Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) if you don't know it yet.

- `**bold**` **bold**
- `_italic_` _italic_
- `__underline__` <span style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>underline</span> (this is not part of Markdown proper, but Discord does support it).
- `~~strikethrough~~` ~~strikethrough~~
- `||spoiler||` for spoiler text (this is not part of Markdown proper, but Discord does support it).
- <code>\`inline code\`</code> for inline code
- `# Heading 1` (and `## Heading 2`, `### Heading 3`, etc.) for headings. **Use these sparingly.**
- `<https://example.com>` to add links. The `<` and `>` are there to disable embedding, which is often disruptive in the server where lots of messages are sent.
- `[text](<https://example.com>)` for links with custom text. It will show up like this: [text](https://example.com). Once again, the `<` and `>` are there to disable embedding.
- `> quote` for blockquotes
- `* list` for unordered lists
- `1. list` for ordered lists

### Code blocks

This part is important. Since the server has a lot of code blocks being shared around, it's highly recommended that you style your code blocks correctly with syntax highlighting. To do so, you use the three backticks (<code>\`\`\`</code>) syntax:

````md
```js
console.log("Hello world!");
```
````

The three backticks tell Markdown that the thing inside is a code block, and the `js` is there to support syntax highlighting. The above code block will look like this:

```js
console.log("Hello world!");
```

In the Next.js Discord server, typically you would frequently use some of the following languages: `js`, `jsx`, `ts` and `tsx`, though other languages like `diff`, `sh`, etc. work fine too. Remove the language identifier if you don't want to add syntax highlighting (e.g. when you paste the build log).

## How can I get the helper role?

The helper ⭐️ role is given to people who are recognised to be active and helpful to other members in the server. It doesn't have a hard rule in terms of eligility but generally speaking, you should be active in the server for a while, actively helping other members with answers that we recognise to be correct, helpful and have high quality (so if you are not sure the answer is correct, _at least_ explicitly specify that; spreading misinformation is known to harm your chance if you intend to get this role in the future).

The [number of accepted answers in the help forum](https://nextjs-forum.com) is a big factor, but once again, there is no hard rule on if and when you get the role.

The helper role has a bit higher privileges than the normal member role, so we are very careful in giving it out. We seek your understandings.

## Are the bots in the server open source and how can I contribute to them?

Yes the two bots specific to this server are open source.

- The Next.js bot source is _technically_ at [vercel/nextjs-discord-bot](https://github.com/vercel/nextjs-discord-bot), though it is a bit unmaintained for a while. The bot instance running in the server, as of 29 August 2023, is by a fork of one of the admins of the server, [rafaelalmeidatk/nextjs-discord-bot-1](https://github.com/rafaelalmeidatk/nextjs-discord-bot-1) so if you want to contribute to the bot, you should contribute to that fork.

- The Next.js Forum bot and web app are both open source at [rafaelalmeidatk/nextjs-forum](https://github.com/rafaelalmeidatk/nextjs-forum).

We always welcome feedbacks and contributions, whether by discussion in `#discord-feedback`, or by code contribution to the repositories above.
